It is FastagFraud Detection using Machine Learning.
In today’s world, Fastag is widely used. 
It is evident that there are progressively more Fastag scams in the current protection system and worldwide integration.
For this reason, Fastag fraud detection is a critical concern. 
The goal in this work is to improve the accuracy of the model by introducing a machine learning based method for identifying Fastag fraud.
To train the model there are  various classification techniques like KNN, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest etc…,
the goal is to attain the best possible model performance in terms of a accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score
